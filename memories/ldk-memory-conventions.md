# Memory File Conventions

**This document defines conventions for creating and maintaining memory files used with Serena MCP or similar memory management systems.**

## Language Convention
- All memory files must be written in English
- This ensures consistency and accessibility across the project
- Technical documentation, procedures, and architectural notes should use English

## File Organization Principles
- **Separate concerns**: Each memory file should focus on a single topic or domain
- **Avoid mixing**: Don't combine unrelated concepts in the same file
- **Clear naming**: File names should clearly indicate their purpose and scope

## Content Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language that is easy to understand
- Structure content logically with appropriate headings
- Include practical examples where helpful
- Keep information current and accurate

## Maintenance
- Regularly review memory files for relevance and accuracy
- Remove or update obsolete information
- Split files that become too large or cover multiple topics
- Merge files that are too small or closely related
